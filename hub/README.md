This example Thing is a hub.  A hub is a bridge that provides an aggregated UI to view any or
all of the child user interfaces.  The hub does not forward packets between children; it
strictly provides an aggregated view into all connected children.

Consider these three Things.  One running the [GPS Locator](../../gps) example, one running the Relays
example, and a third running the Temperature/Pressure example.
